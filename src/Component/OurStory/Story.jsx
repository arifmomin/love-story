                            It all started with a simple message.
                            I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to say, so I sent just three dots: ‚Äú...‚Äù. It may not seem like much, but to me, it was a quiet way of reaching out ‚Äî hoping she would notice, hoping she would reply.
                            
                            And she did.
                            
                            Her reply was a simple ‚ÄúKico Bolben Vahiya‚Äù, but in that small word, something felt different. That one message broke the silence between us and opened a door we never knew existed. From that moment, our conversation began ‚Äî slowly, naturally, and beautifully.
                            
                            What followed were long chats filled with laughter, stories, and a growing connection. Every word felt special. Every reply brought us closer. We weren‚Äôt just talking anymore ‚Äî we were understanding each other in a way we hadn‚Äôt before.

                        There came a moment when our hearts spoke louder than words. It wasn‚Äôt just about feeling close or sharing smiles anymore ‚Äî it was about choosing each other, no matter what the future held.
                           
                           We made a promise ‚Äî a promise of forever.
                           To stand by each other through every joy and challenge,
                           To grow together with love, trust, and patience,

                           And above all, to be loyal to each other for a lifetime ‚Äî
                           two souls, two hearts, forever faithful and true.
                           
                           This promise wasn‚Äôt just spoken; it was felt deeply in our souls ‚Äî a silent vow that whatever comes, we will face it hand in hand.
                           
                           Our promise of forever marked the true beginning of our journey ‚Äî not just as lovers, but as lifelong partners.

                        It was the 4th of February 2025.

                        We met for the very first time ‚Äî quietly, without telling anyone in our families.
                        The place was simple ‚Äî Saydabad Bus Stand.
                        But the moment was anything but ordinary.
                        
                        With nervous hearts and excited eyes, we found each other through a live location and a shared feeling we both couldn‚Äôt explain. It was short, unplanned, and quiet ‚Äî but something about it felt magical.
                        
                        That day, everything felt different.
                        It wasn‚Äôt just a meetup. It was the first step toward something real ‚Äî something we both felt deep inside, even if we didn‚Äôt say it out loud.
                        
                        That first look, that first smile‚Ä¶
                        It stayed with us, long after we walked away.

                           Our wedding came as a surprise during an urgent trip to a village with my family. Though everything happened suddenly and without much planning, it was filled with deep love and wholehearted support from both our families. Their blessings became the foundation that gave us strength and hope to start this new chapter together.
                           
                           As we begin our life side by side, I pray that every day is filled with happiness, peace, and endless love. I want my dear wife to know that
                           I love you üíô ‚Äî today, tomorrow, always and Forever.
                           
                           May our hearts remain forever connected, and may our journey be blessed with joy, understanding, and beautiful memories that last a lifetime. Together, we will build a life full of laughter, support, and unwavering love that grows stronger with each passing day.
